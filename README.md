# Pokemon Go Collaborative Map

## Installation and requirements
```
git clone
npm install

## Maps requirements

To be used, Google Maps must be defined.

For now, the hosted server version can be sued but head to the Google developer console to create a specific project.

Copy your newly created GMaps authorization key. Then put it in the config.js file.


## Server usage

```
npm start
```

## Local versus hosted

The position requirements is only here to help the user focusing the map. Using the hosted version, https must be used. Head to let's encrypt for a low and reliable version


## Security

For now, no accounts are made. It will possibly not be used in the near future.

## Licence
